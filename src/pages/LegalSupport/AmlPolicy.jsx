        <h3 className="mb-4 text-sm">
          Money laundering is the attempt to conceal or disguise the nature,
          location, source, ownership or control of illegally obtained money.
          Money laundering is most commonly associated with tax avoidance.
          However, other individuals may attempt to launder money in order to
          conceal their identity or finance their operations. 'Suspicious
          activity' is a very difficult concept to define because it can vary
          from one transaction to another based upon all the circumstances
          surrounding the transaction or group of transactions. For example,
          transactions by one customer may be normal based on our knowledge of
          that customer and their pattern of activity, while similar
          transactions by another customer may be suspicious. Many factors are
          involved in determining whether transactions are suspicious including
          the amount, the nature of the transaction and frequency of
          deposits/withdrawals from the system.
